This repository contains the code that generates my freelancer profile at [lohrenz.net](https://lohrenz.net). The code is a fork of the [Modern Resum√© Theme](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme) for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) by [James Grant](http://www.jameswgrant.co.uk/), customized to my needs.

If you want to adapt the theme, best have a look at [the original repository](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme).

## Install

```
sudo apt-get install ruby zlib1g-dev
gem update
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## License
